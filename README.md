## Project Name: Anxiety Disorder Awareness

### Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?
Our project addresses the topic of anxiety. As university students, mental health is an extremely important facet of our lives that can be difficult to manage. We aimed to create an experience that lets the user know that they aren't alone and that there are resources out there to help with whatever they may be going through. Additionally, for people who have friends or family around them with anxiety, our website and video project aims to educate them about what an anxiety attack looks like and help them to empathize better with their loved ones who have an anxiety disorder.

Our project falls under option 3: "A HOW TO..." video which addresses How To Navigate Anxiety Disorder: In First and Third Person.

### Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
We created a series of videos showing an example of what anxiety might look like, ways to manage your own anxiety, and how you can help others if you are in the position of a concerned friend. The main page scrolls vertically, showing statistics to show the user that they are not alone in their struggle, and each box links to a different mental health organization. The video is at the bottom, and you can select the video for self-help or to help others. The colors used were initially dark blues and greens to match the topic of anxiety, but were changed to lighter shades to give it a more hopeful feeling.

Additionally, the anxiety video, our main promotional video on how anxiety-attack looks like in a person, is designed and edited to work as a visual and audio representation of how anxiety attack feels like to a person. The video is supposed to be anxiety-inducing, so please watch the video with caution and pause it if you are uncomfortable. Navigate to the help videos if you can relate to the promo-video.


### Challenges:
  1. Getting the emotions into the main character for the promo video was very difficult
  2. Writing the script for the promo video and aligning the scenes one after another to translate an anxiety attack visually and audibly to the audience
  3. Editing the sound and video for the anxiety attack part of the video
  4. Video editing was very new for all of us
  5. Designing the website so it translates the motif and well as the theme of the videos

### Reflection/Evaluation: 
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
Our final version was fairly successful. We had some issues with the filming equipment and ended up using a different camera entirely. The website was also somewhat less interactive than anticipated since the main focus of the project overall is on the video itself.
