## Project Name: Anxiety Disorder Awareness

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
Our project addresses the topic of anxiety. As university students, mental health is an extremely important facet of our lives that can be difficult to manage. Our aim was to create an experience that lets the user know that they aren't alone, and that there are resources out there to help with whatever they may be going through.

#### Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
We created a series of videos showing an example of what anxiety might look like, ways to manage your own anxiety, and how you can help others if you are in the position of a concerned friend. The main page scrolls vertically, showing statistics to show the user that they are not alone in their struggle, and each box links to a different mental health organization. The video is at the bottom, and you can select the video for self-help or to help others. The colours used were intially dark blues and greens to match the topic of anxiety, but were changed to lighter shades to give it a more hopeful feeling.

#### Challenges:
#### Filming:   

#### Video Editing:


#### Reflection/Evaluation: 
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
Our final version was fairly successful. We had some issues with the filming equipment and ended up using a different camera entirely. The website was also somewhat less interactive than anticipated, since the main focus of the project overall is on the video itself.
